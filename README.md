# CreateC
Website <a href="devpython88.github.io">Here</a> <br>
CreateC is simple c++ build tool. It simplifies most aspects of c++ building. Such as adding qt5, gtk, gtkmm.
<br>
<b>You can just add the name of qt5widgets, qt5core, qt5gui, gtkmm, gtk3 (exact names) and the package finding, adding, and compilation will be automatic!</b>

## Requirments

### - atleast 1 MiB of storage

## Note: I am not trying to say that CMake and Make are not good than CreateC in any way!!!!
